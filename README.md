# SICP_JS 

This repository contains my solutions to exercises from the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs: JavaScript Edition." Notice that I have made notes from the original book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" but have decided to solve problems in NodeJS instead of Scheme.

Notable projects includes:
1. developing a rudimentary implementation of JS in Java by translating the explicit-control evaluator of Section 5.4 into Java and providing appropriate storage-allocation routines and other runtime support to run this code.
2. Includes modification of the compiler so that it compiles JS functions into sequences of Java instructions and compiled the metacircular interpreter of Section 4.1 to produce a JS interpreter written in Java.
