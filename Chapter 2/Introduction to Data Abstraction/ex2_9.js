/*
sum of width of a and b = sum of lower bounds of a and b + sum of upper bounds of a and b

subtration of width from a by b
= subtraction of the lower bounds from a by b + subtraction of the upper bounds from a by b

for multiplication and division
e.g. if a = [-2, 2] and b = [-1, 1]

the width does not change after multiplication or division
