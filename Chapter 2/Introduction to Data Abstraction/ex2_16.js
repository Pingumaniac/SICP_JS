/*
The reasons why equivalent algebraic expressions may lead to different answers is that:
1. Data race can occur.

2. Computers use binary number system whereas humans use tenary number systems.
Thus, JavaScript is not a good language for calculation heavy programs.

3. The order of operations is different.

4. The order of arguments matters.

5. The order of evaluation matters.
